# OpenComputers Minecraft Server
This is a Minecraft server that runs inside of OpenComputers, so a Minecraft server in Minecraft.

![Me and someone else on the server](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/126338585707151361/742825199107440680/unknown.png)

## Running
To run the server you first need to un-blacklist "localhost" in OpenComputers configuration.

Now run the bridge software (it's Java code, so you'll need a JVM, i plan to create a .jar soon) and the setup is done.

Now you can just copy the `usr` directory to your OpenComputers computer, type `mc` and then press Enter. Voil√†! You got a Minecraft server ready at port 25565 on your localhost.

(Note: if you want it to be public, you'll still need to port forward your router.)
